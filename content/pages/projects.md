  ## Traditional Indigenous arts

  We pride ourselves on keeping the practices of our ancestors alive, and we host regular meetings at which experts and novices alike come together to practice beading, stitchwork, moccasin sewing, pine needle basketry, and other crafts.


  Check out [our events page](/events) for upcoming meetings!

  ## Scholarships

  Indigenous communities have long been segregated from the structures of social, political, and economic power, and one of the ways in which that segregation has played out has been through the unequal access of education for Indigenous youth. One of Ho Minti Society’s purpose is to support education. 


  Please see [our scholarship page](/scholarships) for criteria and more details.

  ## Self-defence

  Indigenous women and girls face a staggering onslaught of personal violence.


  The murder rate of Indigenous women is three times higher than non-Native women. It is the third leading cause of death for Indigenous women; over 85 percent of them have experienced violence and historical trauma. 


  Our ancestors lived in matrilineal and matrilocal societies where women were respected as sacred life-givers.  We must work diligently to end cultures of toxic misogyny and lateral violence. 


  We support the [Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) movement](https://www.facebook.com/mmiw.tx.rematriate?mibextid=LQQJ4d). We also promote women’s self-defense training.
