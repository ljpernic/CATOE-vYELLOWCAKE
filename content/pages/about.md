# Who we are

### Why Ho Minti?

Ho Minti is a Choctaw phrase that means “y'all come.” We call for a coming back together and a return to traditional American Indian ways of knowing and doing. The name also suggests a kind of in-gathering and renewal that we believe is necessary for our nation and culture to both survive and prosper.

### What are our goals?

The purpose of the group is to promote CULTURAL AWARENESS, SERVICE, COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, and EDUCATION in a way that respects traditional knowledge and the breadth of our history and heritage. We organize regular activities for tribal members and the community at large.

### Where do we fit in?

We acknowledge the Choctaw-Apache tribal council as the governmental entity for the tribal nation to which most of us belong. However, the Ho Minti Society is a Louisiana non-profit organization that operates completely independently from the tribal government. Full membership is open to those eligible for enrollment in the tribe. We also encourage all American Indians and other supporters living in the region to become associate members.

### What do we believe?

The HO MINTI SOCIETY is committed to the following four pillars:

1. Respect for traditional knowledge and cultural vitalization.
2. Reinvigorating cultural knowledge in everyday life through monthly cultural teachings and sharing of cultural knowledge as well as annual meetings.
3. Supporting historical and heritage knowledge through historical and ethnological research and publications.
4. Supporting traditional arts and crafts and artistic development.
