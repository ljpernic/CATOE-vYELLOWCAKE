Youth and Parents get ready for Spring powwows by learning to make dance regalia. This is an ongoing series and is Intertribal (parents and youth from other tribes welcome). This event will be focused on signing up those interested in getting regalia together and measuring for sizes.

Parents, guardians, or other responsible adult are expected to attend and participate in the process. Future workshops will include flat turkey fans, shawl making, and other articles of regalia.
